# **Scientific Calculator**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a **web-based scientific calculator** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as advanced scientific functions such as **square roots, exponents, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, and more**.

The calculator is **interactive and responsive**, meaning it works on both desktop and mobile screens. Users can input expressions using buttons or directly via the keyboard (optional).
